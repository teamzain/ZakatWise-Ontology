# ZakatWise-Ontology

**ZakatWise-Ontology** is a semantic ontology developed to represent and manage Islamic knowledge related to **Zakat**, with a current focus on **agricultural produce**. This project uses the Protégé tool and OWL (Web Ontology Language) to formally define concepts such as **Ushr**, **land types**, **irrigation methods**, and **agricultural produce types** to support intelligent reasoning and querying.

##  Current Features

- Representation of zakat rules on **agricultural produce**
- Classification of **land types** (e.g., irrigated, rain-fed)
- Modeling of **irrigation methods** and their zakat implications
- Categorization of **crops and produce**
- Semantic structure for **Ushr calculation** and eligibility



##  Tools & Technologies

- [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/)
- OWL (Web Ontology Language)
- RDF & SPARQL for semantic querying
- DL Query for class-level reasoning

##  How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `Agriculture Taxation Ontology.owl` using [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/).
3. Explore classes, properties, and individuals.
4. Use DL Query or SPARQL tab for intelligent queries and reasoning.
